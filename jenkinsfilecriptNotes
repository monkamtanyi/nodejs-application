//Code - Build - Test - CodeQualityReport - UploadArtifacts - Deployment - Email Notification
//This pipeline script written in groovy. Now if we have many projects, it means we go thro each stage. But we can write 
common script that can be refereced to build other scripts.


node
{
 
  stage("CheckOutCodeGit") {
   sh "start of project"
  sh "This is a java project for boa"
  git 'https://github.com/LandmarkTechnology/wep-app'   // used to pull the code from github = Code pull
}
 
 stage("Test+Build") {
   // Building with maven
  // sh "mvn validate"
  // sh "mvn compile"
  // sh "mvn test"     note mvn package will execute the 3 commands above which is commented.
     sh "mvn package"  

    }
 
 
  stage('CodeQualityReport') {
   sh " echo running code quality report analysis"
   sh "sonar:sonar    // sonar plugin and sonar goal to execute sonar report"   
   
    }
      
        } 
		
    stage('UploadArtifacts') {
      sh " echo uploading artifacts in nexus"
       sh "mvn deploy"
      }	
 
 stage('Development') {
  sh "echo app now ready for deployment"
// in deploying the application we just copy the application code from the build server (web-app dir) to
//the deployment server (web-server dir)
    sh "scp app.war ec2-user@172.28.19.2:/opt/tomcat9/webapps/"
    }
stage ('Notification'){
sh "mail"     // mail is a command in linux
sh "echo slackchannel"    //to also notify members on slack channels
    
  }
}
Doing the above jenkins pipeline Script is a tedious process, especially as we have many projects. to solve this we use 
Jenkins Shared Libraries JSL:
Jekins Shared Libraries is a concept of having a common pipeline code in the version control system that can be used 
by any number of pipelines just by referencing it. Infact, multiple teams can use the same library for their pipelines.
It is just like calling a function.
programming and scripting languages that we have done in landmark
- bash-shell scripting
-groovy

How do we set up JSL:
-Create shared libraries     jSL has a variable vars dir 
- configure Library
- Use Library in pipeline script

Creating Shared Libraries:
IN the var dir, we have a script called the common groovy, this has steps common to all the stages which can be used for
automation.
//common.groovy   this is the name of the shared library
// under we are calling each fn (eg sh "mvn clean package") based on the stage name. u can run many commands 
at each stage (eg lile sh " echo running code quality report analysis")
def call(String stageName){
  
  if ("${stageName}" == "Build") {
       sh "mvn clean package"
     }
  else if ("${stageName}" == "SonarQube Report")   {
        sh " echo running code quality report analysis"
       sh "mvn clean sonar:sonar"
     }
  else if ("${stageName}" == "Upload Into Nexus")
     {
       sh "mvn clean deploy"
     }
}

Above is creating a shared libraries, next configure library:
copu the repo were the jenkins library is found
https://github.com/monkamtanyi/JenkinsSharedLibraries
goto jkbrowser,db>managejk>configure system>global pipeline libraries>libraryname=   (u can have multiple libraries) >
default version=master-allow defaut version overriden, include@library changes in job recent changes.>
retrieval methoe=modernscm>git>enter jenkins library repo - https://github.com/monkamtanyi/JenkinsSharedLibraries>enter
cred?>save>jenkins shared library is configured.
Next:select a project or lets create one called ebay-bts>pipeline project>ok>conf>ok>pipeline>

Jenkinsfile start jenkinsfile for shared libraries like this  (SS =software solution)
//@Library('LibraryName') _
@Library('monkamtanyiSS-Sharedlibs') _
pipeline{                   //we are going to create a declarative pipeline
agent any
tools{
     maven "maven3.9.6"
  }
stages{
 stage('gitPull') {   //we want to pull d code from our PubGithubRepo
    steps {
        sh "echo start of ebay-bts project"
         git ' https://github.com/monkamtanyi/JenkinsSharedLibraries' 
        //git pull is not part of my shared library, if u check the library file there is no stage as git pull)
       //CTrl+C copy pipelinscript Ctrl+V =paste in jkPipeline>
     }
  }
 }
}
